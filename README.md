# Star Wars Invite - Built With Phaser

This is a Star Wars birthday invitation I created for my kid's 5th birthday. It uses the Phaser Game Engine and is written in ES6 using Babel and WebPack for the build proccess.

1. Clone Repo
2. npm install
3. npm start ( compiles code and runs the app on localhost:3000 )
